# ✅ AI FIX ISSUE - RESOLVED!

## Problem
The AI fix feature was failing with a 404 error:
```
[GoogleGenerativeAI Error]: Error fetching from https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-1.5-flash:generateContent: 
[404 Not Found] models/gemini-1.5-flash is not found for API version v1beta
```

## Root Cause
The original code used the model name `gemini-1.5-flash`, which is **no longer available** in the Gemini API v1beta. The Gemini API has been updated with new model versions.

## Solution
Updated the model name from `gemini-1.5-flash` to **`gemini-2.5-flash`** which is currently available and supports `generateContent`.

### Files Modified:
- **`backend/src/services/playground.service.ts`**
  - Line 121: Changed model from `gemini-1.5-flash` to `gemini-2.5-flash`
  - Line 179: Changed model from `gemini-1.5-flash` to `gemini-2.5-flash`

## Available Models (as of October 2025)
The Gemini API now provides these models for text generation:

### Recommended Models:
- ✅ **`gemini-2.5-flash`** - Fast, efficient (CURRENT CHOICE)
- ✅ **`gemini-2.5-pro`** - More powerful, higher quality
- ✅ **`gemini-flash-latest`** - Always points to latest flash model
- ✅ **`gemini-pro-latest`** - Always points to latest pro model

### Other Available Models:
- `gemini-2.0-flash`
- `gemini-2.0-pro-exp`
- Many preview and experimental versions

## Test Result
✅ **AI Fix is now working!**

### Test Input:
```javascript
function test( { console.log("test") }
```

### AI Response:
```json
{
    "fixedCode": "function test() {\n  console.log(\"test\");\n}",
    "explanation": "The original code had several syntax errors related to defining a JavaScript function...",
    "changes": [
        "Added a closing parenthesis `)` after function name",
        "Added opening curly brace `{` to mark beginning of function body",
        "Added closing curly brace `}` to close function body",
        "Removed extraneous `{` incorrectly placed",
        "Added semicolon `;` after console.log statement"
    ]
}
```
